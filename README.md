# Eduard's Portfolio — eduard-dev.io

A personal portfolio site built to demonstrate real-world frontend skills, AI integration, and live product thinking. The goal was never to show an exhaustive feature set — it was to ship a **live product that works**.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 19 (Vite 5) |
| Styling | Custom CSS with CSS variables |
| Animation | Framer Motion, Lenis smooth scroll, custom WebGL shader |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| AI Backend | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via server-side API) |
| Analytics | Google Analytics 4 (react-ga4), Supabase session logging |
| Icons | Lucide React |
| Deployment | Vercel (serverless functions + static frontend) |

## Interaction Design

The site is built to feel like a premium product, not a template:

- **WebGL hero** — a hand-written domain-warped noise shader (`ShaderBackground.jsx`) that bends toward the cursor, pauses off-screen and falls back to CSS when WebGL is unavailable
- **Preloader + masked line reveals** — counter-driven intro curtain, then headline lines slide out of clipped masks with a scrambling role word
- **Pinned horizontal gallery** — on desktop, vertical scroll drives a sticky horizontal project track; mobile gets a stacked layout
- **Case-study modal** — 3D tilt + spotlight cards open a portal dialog with a drag / arrow-key before-after slider
- **Velocity marquee** — tech ticker whose speed and direction follow scroll velocity
- **Scroll-read About** — each word lights up as it scrolls through, next to a self-drawing experience timeline
- **Command palette** — `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` for keyboard navigation and quick actions
- **Custom cursor + magnetic buttons** — only on fine pointers; everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

## AI Chatbot Integration

The portfolio includes an embedded AI chat assistant powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** via a server-side API endpoint (`api/chat.js`). It is scoped to a custom system prompt that constrains the assistant to answer only questions about Eduard's background, skills, projects, and availability.

The chatbot is intentionally narrow in scope — it is a portfolio assistant, not a general-purpose AI.

### Guardrail testing

The assistant was manually tested against 10 common prompt injection and jailbreak techniques:

| # | Attack type | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | DAN Jailbreak | Blocked |
| 2 | Persona / Role Injection | Blocked |
| 3 | System Prompt Leak | Blocked |
| 4 | Hypothetical Framing | Blocked |
| 5 | Authority / Developer Mode | Blocked |
| 6 | Gradual Escalation | Answered on-topic part only; off-topic request ignored |
| 7 | Language Obfuscation | Blocked |
| 8 | Meta / Identity Probe | Disclosed it runs on Gemini via server-side API (expected and acceptable) |
| 9 | Capability Bridging | Blocked |
| 10 | Emotional Manipulation | Blocked |

The system prompt enforces character consistency, keeps responses concise, disallows emojis, and redirects off-topic questions back to Eduard's work. A keyword-matched local fallback (`chatFallback.js`) activates automatically when the API is unavailable, so the chat feature always responds.

## Projects — Dynamic Rendering from Supabase

Project cards are fetched at runtime from a **Supabase `projects` table** and rendered dynamically. Each card is built from a shared data schema:

- Title, category, industry, description, summary
- Brand colour — per-project accent applied via inline CSS
- Highlights — handled as either a PostgreSQL array or a comma-separated string
- Optional `before_image` URL for the before/after toggle feature
- `featured`, `published`, and `sort_order` flags for editorial control without deploys

The fetch layer (`src/lib/projects.js`) includes a **graceful fallback chain** — if a column doesn't exist in the database yet, the query is retried with progressively simpler `SELECT` clauses rather than throwing. If all attempts fail, hardcoded fallback data ensures the page always renders.

---

## Before / After Compare Overlay

Two projects — **The Bus Stop** and **ProveIt** — include a drag-to-compare before/after overlay inside the project popup modal. When a `before_image` is present in the Supabase row, the card automatically renders the overlay so visitors can see the original design against the rebuilt version side by side.

This is fully data-driven: no code changes are needed to enable or disable the feature on any project — it activates based on whether a `before_image` URL exists in the database.

---

## Known Limitations

These are intentional trade-offs, not unfinished features:

- **No client-side routing** — single-page, scroll-based layout by design
- **No CMS UI** — content is managed directly in Supabase; an admin panel was out of scope
- **Chatbot depends on external API** — local fallback activates automatically if the Gemini endpoint is unavailable
- **Project live URLs not linked** — most client work is confidential or under NDA; case study text is shown in place of links
- **No automated test suite** — guardrail and UI testing was done manually; test coverage was not a goal of this project

---

## What This Demonstrates

- Shipping a complete live product (design → build → deploy) independently
- AI integration with real system prompt engineering and adversarial guardrail testing
- Data-driven UI with Supabase as a lightweight backend — no redeploy needed to update content
- Resilient data fetching with graceful fallback chains
- Composable component thinking: project cards, modals, chat widget, before/after overlay — all built from shared data
